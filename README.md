   a. Questioning: The player can ask questions from a preset list. Questioning may yield more questions or new information/evidence (such as a statement that may be contradictory to another piece of evidence or another statement).
   b. Accusing: The player can accuse the individual of an action from a preset list. To back up with evidence, they must select the correct piece of evidence from their desk.
   c. Reviewing evidence: Players can look at their desk and review all types of evidence. They can examine individual pieces of evidence by dragging them to the bottom of the screen.
