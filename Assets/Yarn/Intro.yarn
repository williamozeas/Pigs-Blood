Boy: W-woah! Matches!
Matches: You're up as soon as you're ready. You alright?
Boy: Yeah... Right as rain.

Matches: HEY! You're doing it again!
<<PlayEffect Failure>>
Boy: Um. Yeah! I'm fine.
Matches: I picked up this wolf fleeing from the scene. I believe you two are acquainted? I wrote a profile on him, should be in your evidence... 
<<wait 1>>
<<PlayEffect Failure>>
Matches: ...pile.
Boy: Yeah. He's broken a few rules here and there. Should be easy enough.
Matches: Alright, well, this is a bit more than a few rules. This is a murder.
Matches: We need you at your best for this. Have you looked over the evidence?
Boy: Uh. Definitely.
<<PlayEffect Failure>>
Matches: ...Convincing. Have another look.

Boy: He's 39. Says so right on his report.
Matches: Glad my work writing those isn't in vain. Even if your workspace is as organized as a burning building.
Boy: Very funny. I have my methods. Besides, have I let you down yet?
Matches: Of course not. You're as good a detective as we've ever seen here. Though, I'll be watching from the next room if you need help.

Matches: You ready?
Boy: As I'll ever be.
