        External
        Examination:

        The victim is identified as a male pig of approximately
        5 years old. The pig is 3 feet tall and weighs approximately 150 pounds.
        The victim has suffered extensive head trauma, with multiple lacerations
        and fractures to the skull. There are also several large contusions on the
        torso and limbs. The cause of death is consistent with blunt force trauma
        to the head.'

      propertyPath: pagesText.Array.data[1]
      value: 'Internal Examination:

        The skull is fractured in several places.
        The brain itself is severely damaged, with evidence of hemorrhage and contusions.
        The victim''s lungs are filled with blood, indicating that the pig likely
        bled out while waiting for medical attention. There are also multiple fractures
        to the ribs and sternum. The liver and kidneys show signs of minor damage,
        likely caused by blunt force trauma.


        Toxicology:

        Trace
        amounts of psychedelic substances were detected in blood and urine samples.
        Victim was not under influence at time of death, but may have taken some
        variation of drug within the past few days.'
